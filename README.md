# IntroToMachineLearning
Repository for the Final Project on Machine Learning, Udacity, Data Analyist Nanodegree

This repository contains the required and supporting files for the final project on Machine Learning. It documents my steps into exploring the data and developing the final classifier.

* [Project Overview](Project\_Overview.md)
* [Project Details](Project\_Details.md)
* [Project Submission Instructions](Project\_Submission\_Instructions.md)

# Main Files:
 * [poi\_id.py](poi\_id.py): final python code for filtering the data, preparing and selecting features and creating the classifier
 * [Question\_Responses.ipynb](Question\_Responses.ipynb): Responses to Udacity's questions
 * [MachineLearning\_Project\_Notes.ipynb](MachineLearning\_Project\_Notes.ipynb): Notes summarize my steps, findings and decision making process
 * [References.md](References.md): A list of Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories etc. that I referred to or used in this submission 
 
# Supporting Files
